Hello, Everyone, my name is Johan Wijaya, Nice to meet you. I am a computer-science student in University Bunda Mulia. Actually, I love to learn new every single day. Now I had an interest in Programming. I love reading books and playing basketball in my free time, sometimes I go out with my friends and discusses hobby, new project, and many things. If you want to discuss something or want to become a friend of mine,just add me. It would be my distinct pleasure to know about you.Thank You Very Much.
